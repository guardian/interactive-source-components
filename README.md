## Getting started

Install the package using NPM or your package manager of choice.

```bash
npm install git+git@github.com:guardian/interactive-source-components.git
```

The package exports CSS files for each component, eg.
`"@guardian/interactive-source-components/button.css"`, containing classes that make your HTML look
all Guardian.

These files can be imported using Javascript's `import`, or CSS's `@import`.

For example, using these styles in a Svelte component will look something like this.

```svelte
<script>
  import "@guardian/interactive-source-components/button.css"
  import "@guardian/interactive-source-components/icons.css"
</script>

<button class="src-button src-button--tertiary">
  <div class="src-icon--add-to-basket"></div>
  Click me
</button>
```

> [!WARNING]  
> These CSS files contain classes that cover many of the possible configuration options for each component, eg. `src-button--small`, `src-button--tertiary`.
>
> Ensure that your build system is set up to remove unused CSS classes, such as using the [@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss) PostCSS plugin.
